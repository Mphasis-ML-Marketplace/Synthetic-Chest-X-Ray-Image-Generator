# Synthetic Chest X-Ray Image Generator

## Product Overview
In medical domain, its often challenging to collect large and diverse dataset due to privacy concerns and limited access to patient data.  Real medical images may contain sensitive patient information, and sharing or using such data for research can raise privacy and ethical concerns. Synthetic images offer a way to bypass these issues as they do not contain any real patient data. Some rare health disease or conditions may have limited available data. Synthetic data can be used to augment the existing dataset, increasing its size and diversity and balance class distribution. Given a reference image, this solution can generate upto 3 synthetic images.  The generated images show some variations in synthesis without deviating from the underlying representations it has learnt from the real chest Xray images.


## Product Highlight
* The solution can be used to demonstrate examples of several medical conditons which would facilitate research on new image analysis algorithms in medical domain. 
* This solution is trained on CheXpert dataset, which is a large dataset of Chest X-Rays. It uses deep learning based generative models that allows for the synthesis of realistic images which capture the underlying distribution of the training data.
* Mphasis Synth Studio is an Enterprise Synthetic Data Platform for generating high-quality synthetic data that can help derive and monetize trustworthy business insights, while preserving privacy and protecting data subjects. Build reliable and high accuracy models when no or low data is available.
